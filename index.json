So this is what we\u0026rsquo;ll do now in Go.\nFor this tutorial I\u0026rsquo;ll consider that you have go installed in your machine. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have go installed in your machine please access the Go documentation and follow the steps into installation section.\nWriting your code Start creating a folder hello in your computer and inside of it create a new file called main.go. Next, add this content to main.go file\npackage main\rimport \u0026quot;fmt\u0026quot;\rfunc main() {\rfmt.Println(\u0026quot;Hello, World\u0026quot;)\r}\r Let\u0026rsquo;s look through the code and understand the code.\nIn the first line we have the package declaration\npackage main\r Every go program is made up of packages and the program start running in package main.\nIn the next line we are using a package inside our program.\nimport \u0026quot;fmt\u0026quot;\r In our case we are using the package \u0026ldquo;fmt\u0026rdquo; to use a function to print a message on the screen.\nFollowing the code we have the function main\nfunc main() {\rfmt.Println(\u0026quot;Hello, World\u0026quot;)\r}\r Every Go program has one and only one function main and inside of it you put what your program have to do. In this piece of code we are just calling the function Println from the fmt package and passing \u0026ldquo;Hello World\u0026rdquo; as argument. The function Println from \u0026ldquo;fmt\u0026rdquo; package just print the message passed as argument and appends a new line.\nExecuting the program To execute a go program you have to use the Go command to compile and run the program. Inside the folder that you created the main.go, run the command like this:\n$ go run main.go\r\u0026quot;Hello, World\u0026quot;\r For the moment, that\u0026rsquo;s all.\nThanks for reading, see you in the next post.\n","date":1588896000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588896000,"objectID":"ccc9de38b39556840eaf2ce1e66f72fa","permalink":"https://leogsouza.github.io/post/your-first-program-in-go/","publishdate":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/your-first-program-in-go/","section":"post","summary":"Hi Everyone, when we are learning a new programming language it\u0026rsquo;s common starting with the classic \u0026ldquo;Hello, World\u0026rdquo; program.

I am a self-taught Brazilian Software Developer that enjoys learning new things and sharing what I learn. I have over 14 years working in a variety of technologies and I am specialized in Backend and API Development a variety of technologies. I also have good experience with Frontend and a little bit with Mobile. When I am not coding, I usually spare my time with my family.\nWhy did I create this blog? Well, some reasons encouraged me to create this blog:\n I am studying English and I need to improve my skills to become fluent. So, I see that writing is a good way to improve them. I want to boost my coding skills and increase my knowledge in software development. And for me, writing could allow me to understand and explain with more details a specific subject and then master it (applying Feynman Technique). I also want to share my personal experiences that could be useful for anyone who\u0026rsquo;s living a similar situation.  Conclusion So, this is my first post and I know that maybe I made some mistakes but I\u0026rsquo;ll improve my writing skills as I write more and certainly give more interesting subjects.\nFeel free to reach out with your thoughts.\nThank you!!\n","date":1578182400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578182400,"objectID":"3f289ad9deff50f67a8232b628d934fb","permalink":"https://leogsouza.github.io/post/hello-world/","publishdate":"2020-01-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/hello-world/","section":"post","summary":"Hello Everyone, my name is Leonardo Souza and at the beginning of this year I decided to change my old website and create a blog to writing about anything that I wanted.\nWho am I?
