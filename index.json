I am a self-taught Brazilian Software Developer that enjoys learning new things and sharing what I learn. I have over 14 years working in a variety of technologies and I am specialized in Backend and API Development a variety of technologies. I also have good experience with Frontend and a little bit with Mobile. When I am not coding, I usually spare my time with my family.\nWhy did I create this blog? Well, some reasons encouraged me to create this blog:\n I am studying English and I need to improve my skills to become fluent. So, I see that writing is a good way to improve them. I want to boost my coding skills and increase my knowledge in software development. And for me, writing could allow me to understand and explain with more details a specific subject and then master it (applying Feynman Technique). I also want to share my personal experiences that could be useful for anyone who's living a similar situation.  Conclusion So, this is my first post and I know that maybe I made some mistakes but I'll improve my writing skills as I write more and certainly give more interesting subjects.\nFeel free to reach out with your thoughts.\nThank you!!\n","date":1578182400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578182400,"objectID":"3f289ad9deff50f67a8232b628d934fb","permalink":"https://leogsouza.github.io/post/hello-world/","publishdate":"2020-01-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/hello-world/","section":"post","summary":"Hello Everyone, my name is Leonardo Souza and at the beginning of this year I decided to change my old website and create a blog to writing about anything that I wanted.\nWho am I?
